# KIM UNO  
  
An implementation of KIM-1 using Arduino Nano. Keyboard and display were wired by hand. The assembled board ran very well, however after a few days it stopped working. Due to the mess of wire, it is very unlikely that it can be fixed.  
However, making this project was fun and taught me about multiplexed keyboards and seven segment displays, and also about the programming of 6502 microcontroller.
